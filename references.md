## Some Common Terms

The term definitions are provided in the context of information development.  

* **Static Site Generators**&mdash;Simply put, they take a template directory with raw text files in various formats, run it through a converter, and spit it out as a complete and ready-to-publish static website.
* **Wiki**&mdash;A website or database which is developed by the collaborative efforts of users.
* **DITA**&mdash;Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is a standard XML-based architecture for representing documents for consumption by humans. It provides architectural features for content modularity, content reuse, and controlled extension of document vocabularies.
* **DITA Open Toolkit**&mdash;DITA is the principle while DITA Open Toolkit is what makes it come into practice. DITA Open Toolkit is an open-source publishing engine for XML content authored in the Darwin Information Typing Architecture. More @ [http://www.dita-ot.org/](http://www.dita-ot.org/).
* **Reusability**&mdash;The ability of a chunk of text to be used in many places without altering it.
* **Module**&mdash;The smallest possible chunk of content that can be reused.
* **Modularization**&mdash;The ability to organize content into chunks that can be readily reused in many places.  
* **Minimalism**&mdash;In a nutshell: fewer words, greater impact; the right information in the right moment; avoiding adjectives in technical documentation.
* **Topic-Based Writing**&mdash;The purpose of the information determines types of topics which serve a particular purpose and which, however, can be mixed:
    * **Concept**&mdash;Answers the question "What is this?" and provides descriptions.
    * **Task**&mdash;Answers the questions "How does this work?" and provides procedures.
    * **Reference**&mdash;Displays same-level information for user reference like in encyclopedias. This article is a reference topic.
* **Customer Journey**&mdash;Involves every interaction with your company, product, or service and spans a variety of touchpoints by which the customer moves from awareness to engagement and purchase.
* **Customer Experience**&mdash;Represents every step of the journey from when users are running price comparisons, try the product, to when users may resort to customer service if their needs aren’t met.
* **User Experience**&mdash;The experience of the customer or user with a specific product such as a website, app, or software.
* **Persona**&mdash;A representation of a fictitious user that includes a concise summary of characteristics of the user, their experience, goals and tasks, pain points, and environmental conditions. Personas describe the target users of a tool, site, product or application, giving a clear picture of how they're likely to use the system, and what they’ll expect from it.
* **Matrix**&mdash;A grid that represents groups of people from your target audience in terms of who does what, helps determine the tasks and the expectations of each group from the documentation and the purpose the group will use it for.   
* **Funnel Matrix**&mdash;An analytical tool that determines the stages of customer conversion. A potential customer starts with the awareness for your product, then is interested in it, desires to buy it, finally, acts upon the desire and buys it.
* **Conversion Rate**&mdash;The number of conversions (first-time buyers of your product or service) divided by the number of total ad clicks.

## Some Handy Tools

* [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/)&mdash;A static site generator. It is also the engine behind GitHub Pages and you can also use it to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.
* [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/)&mdash;An open-source static site generator.
* [**GitHub**](https://github.com/)&mdash;A web-based version control repository and Internet hosting service.
* [**Jenkins**](https://jenkins.io/)&mdash;An open source automation server written in Java, which helps automate the non-human part of the software development process and facilitate the technical aspects of continuous delivery.
* [**Confluence**](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)&mdash;A team collaboration software.
* [**Atom**](https://atom.io/)&mdash;A free and open-source text and source code editor developed by GitHub.
* [**Sublime**](https://www.sublimetext.com/)&mdash;A proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface.
